# secret-satan
A simple program that creates random pairs of persons that want to bring each other anonymous gifts :)

Everything you need is:
- Write your SMTP settings in SecretSatan.exe.config [App.config in solution]
- Write your message in message.txt (the first line will be a subject of email messages)
- Add all of the persons with emails to persons.txt (Name:Email)
- Run the program
- Celebrate and drink!

To make it work only these files are needed: SecretSatan.exe, SecretSatan.exe.config, persons.txt, message.txt
.NET 4.0 must be installed. And nothing more.

Have a nice holiday :]
